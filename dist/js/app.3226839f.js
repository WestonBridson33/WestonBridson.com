time. It was why \n        I decided to learn how to write code. After spending the weekend at a retreat held by the Newman \n        Center at Illinois State University, I was fired up and decided it was time to start working toward that \n        goal.

I \n        actually came up with the name, "Let There Be Light" first. The idea that followed was an \n        exploration based platformer with no combat. The setting would have been very dark and the game \n        would have been about using light to dispel the darkness so the player could find their way to \n        heaven.

I got right to work and began making my prototype. I grabbed \n    this png online and made him move and crafted an area to walk around in. I created objects that \n    would trigger shortcuts to open. And lastly, a light. As I walked around trying to think of how this\n    game would work, I realized that this was not very exciting and quickly became boring. So, I went \n    back to the drawing board. I started thinking about what I wanted this game to accomplish and I \n    settled on two main points. \n    \n    1.) I wanted to expose the Catholic faith to the world. It is something that is often misunderstood \n        and something that I felt I had to hide for most of my life. I hoped that if more media with Catholic \n        themes and imagery existed, then people would be more accepting of it. This point would inspire a \n        lot of the art and setting of the game. \n        \n    2.) I wanted share some of the lessons I have learned while pursuing my faith. One of the strongest \n        lessons I've learned is the importance of being able to recognize your own weakness and rely on \n        your community to lift you up. Though, I've always been a bit solitary, so it was always much \n        easier for me to look to heaven for assistance. I wanted to reflect this in the main character. \n        \n    My first thought was to have the source of his power be directly from God, but I didn't love this idea. \n    I wanted God's involvement to be more subtle. That's when I thought about the saints. I knew very \n    little about them, but had been hearing about them more and more while being at the Newman \n    Center. Involving them in this way would give me more of a reason to get to know them more, which \n    was something I wanted to do. So, I had a main character in pursuit of heaven. He was powerless \n    on his own, but had the saints, who were very devoted to God, to assist him on his journey.

He pointed out a lot of issues with the design of my site. I both \n    appreciated and loathed the criticisms. It extended the development time of the website by about \n    3-4 weeks, but I am much happier with the end result than I would have been without his guidance. So I am definitely thankful for his help. \n    \n    I finished the site some time in February. As stated before, I originally planned on starting to work \n    on \"Let There Be Light\" again, but decided it would be better to wait until I move into my new \n    apartment in May. I decided that I would take a week off and then begin some online courses \n    on game development. \"Why the courses,\" you might ask? Well, for my job, the company I work for \n    bought me a course on Udemy for a framework called VueJS. This course was 80 hours and gave \n    me a great foundation for the framework. Any foundation I have for game development has come \n    from random youtube videos that did not build off of each other very well. Any foundation I \n    currently have in game development is covered with cracks. I want to fill those cracks so I can be more confident in my abilities. \n    \n    Unfortunately, before I got started on those courses, I fell into another deep slump. My routine \n    suffered, my prayer life suffered, my motivation suffered. This is exactly the reason why I decided to \n    ease back into development with a smaller project. During the slump, I became frustrated with \n    myself for entering this state of low energy again. It happens way too often and I needed to figure \n    out why and deal with it. But of course, I was in the middle of a slump, so I didn't have much energy \n    to do that. For the next month and half or so, I spent 90% of my free time just playing games. I \n    enjoyed that time at least, but I wasn't happy with how compulsively I was playing them.\n    \n    In the last few weeks, I started re-connecting with some friends I haven't seen in a long time, and \n    making more of an effort to check-in with those I am close with. This definitely helped me to break \n    out of the slump. After spending some time self reflecting and speaking with a local priest, I \n    decided that I should just try to be more social. These slumps seem to start with me getting sucked \n    into a game and realizing how fun and easy it is to just sit in front of my computer and not worry \n    about anything else. I hoped that by making more of an effort to be around friends and family, I \n    would be less likely to let myself be so isolated. The priest didn't discount this idea, but was wise \n    enough to see that I might struggle with actually making that happen. I have always been more \n    antisocial, and it doesn't take too much social activity to run my batteries dry. He then suggested \n    that I get a dog. I laughed at first because I didn't expect that answer from a priest, but it actually \n    made a lot of sense. He explained that it wouldn't require much social energy, but it would require \n    me to focus on it throughout the day. I wouldn't be able to totally isolate myself with this creature\n    relying on me for food and exercise. And, I can't say this was the first time I had considered getting \n    a dog in recent months. The life of an antisocial full-time web-developer, part-time game-developer, \n    passionate video gamer can easily get pretty lonely. Normally my connection with God has always \n    gotten me through that feeling, but there are less people in my life now than there ever has been \n    before. A dog might be the perfect answer to that problem.\n    \n    I haven't made any decisions yet, and there are other expenses that I need to take care of before I \n    even start looking at what I would need to take care of a dog. But I wanted to update you all on what \n    had been going on in my life and let you know that I still plan on returning to video making in May. I \n    would really like to be able to work consistently on \"Let There Be Light,\" and make regular dev-log \n    videos on Youtube. But, in order for that to happen I have to identify and remove the obstacles that \n    have caused me to stop in the past. So, I apologize for the wait, but I believe it will pay off in the \n    long run.

After some pretty deep reflection \n    on the topic, I learned that I no longer really cared for the game that I was creating. Let There Be Light was originally supposed to be a short and simple platformer. The only purpose of this project was to introduce me to real indie game development and the challenges that come with it. It was never meant to be so complex. However, I was very excited about finally creating something from scratch and bringing it to life. I remember talking frequently about it with my friends at the Newman Center. I did not notice how heavily I was allowing the game to be influenced by the ideas we were sharing. Over time the identity of the project got so skewed in both scale and direction that in some ways, it no longer felt like something I wanted to continue working on. \n    \n    It was a tough decision, but it was time to move on from Let There Be Light. I had gotten the knowledge and experience that I needed from it and I was ready to work on something that I was more passionate about. However, I was still very proud of the work that I accomplished in this game. I am greatly pleased with how the character movement and attacks all turned out. It looked good, it felt good, and it was good. I thought it would be a bit of a shame to just toss it all aside, especially with a whole youtube series following its development. So, I decided to take what I had and mold it into a complete and playable experience. After all, a short and complete game would look better in a portfolio than another complex failed attempt.\n    \n    So, I decided to treat the rest of development the same way I treated my last game jam. Instead of asking "What features would benefit this game?" I asked "What features are absolutely necessary for release." My focus was much less on quality at this point and more on efficiency. Remember, this game is more of a stepping stone than a destination. So I decided to change the premise of this game from "2D Platformer Souls-like," to "2D Platformer Rouge-lite." This would allow me to make a small arena with randomly spawning enemies that could be reused, greatly decreasing development time. So I built the arena, a safe place for the player to manage his upgrades, spawning functionality for my enemies, a score system, and a wave system. Then I made an opening cutscene and tinkered with spawn rates and wave difficulty until I was happy with it. I play tested it extensively and even had some friend play test it. It was nowhere near perfect, but we all had a lot of fun. And that was an experience I have been looking forward too since I first started game development. There\'s a lot more I would\'ve liked to add to the game, but it is simply time to move on. I am very proud of what I have made and very excited to see what the future holds.  \n    \n    The game will be downloadable from the project\'s main page, which can be found on the home page.

I wanted to keep the game simple and just get the experience of a full development cycle. As for the setting, I drew a lot of inspiration from the John Paul II Catholic Newman Center on my school\'s campus. It was to be a materialization of one\'s spiritual struggle between good and evil. In my first draft, there would be no combat, but the player would navigate a dark and cold world via 2D platforming, using a lantern to light the way. The player character\'s reliance on the lantern was meant to be an allegory for reliance on God. However, after building a quick prototype, I did not think it would be too fun. I wanted to add some sort of combat, but I wanted to keep that idea of the player character relying on powers outside of himself. \n      \n      \t\tThe Subject of Catholic Saints was discussed quite frequently at the Newman Center. Thus the idea of the player character relying on them manifested in my head and eventually into the game. The combat went through a few iterations, but in the final version I decided to make one robust move set based on Saint Michael. He was the most obvious choice because he is often depicted wielding a flaming sword, and he is very well known. Then, to add some variety, I added "Saint Cards." These were items the player could equip to alter his stats. The cards would also have some information about the saint that the player could read if they were interested. \n\n      \t\tAs for progression, I was planning to follow the Dark Souls formula of slaying enemies, gaining experience, pushing through levels to find checkpoints, and finding bosses to take down until you made it to the end of the game. I did get the level up system created and it ended up working pretty well. But, before I ever got around to designing levels or bosses, I noticed something wasn\'t feeling very off about the game. So much so, that I was struggling to focus on development. While searching for the cause of this issue, I realized that the direction of the game had totally spiraled in the wrong direction. \n      \n      \t\tDuring the inception of Let There Be Light and the thick of its development, I was very active at the Newman Center. I talked about the game quite a bit with the other members of the community and I think that somewhere along the line, I started to make development decisions based on what I thought that community would like and approve of. My original idea for the game conveyed a subtletheme of "Light dispels the darkness," But as I looked at what I had created, I no longer recognized it. The core of the game had totally changed, and it a lot of ways, so had I. This was mythird year of development for Let There Be Light and they were a very eventful 3 years. I no longer had the same connection to the game I had when I first created it. As hard as it wasto accept, I knew it was time for me to move on to my next project. \n\n      \t\tHowever, as much as I wanted to set the game aside and start something new, there was still a lot to be proud of. My controls felt great, my attacks looked awesome, and my progression system was fun. I decided that instead of stepping away from it forever immediately, I would transform it into something that could be completed in two weeks. Like a self imposed game jam. I created a spawn area for the player, a small arena, random enemy spawning functionality, and a score system. And just like that, Let There Be Light was now a rogue-lite. I play tested it extensively and even had some friends play test it. We all had a lot of fun and I was very happy to finally see people playing the game. It is far from perfect, but I am still very happy\n      with the result. Finally, I can say, "Let There Be Light is complete".\n\n      \t\tThough I may not be super happy with how the game turned out, I am still very proud of my accomplishment. It feels very good to finally have a game that I can call "Complete." If you would like to try it, the game can be downloaded completely free above! Thank you to everyone who supported me over the years. Without your encouragement, the game likely would not exist at all.

This was my first game jam and I was equally nervous and excited. We had one week to make a game under the theme of \"An End is a New Beginning.\" The jam started early in the morning of Sunday February 12th 2023. I wasted no time getting started and began to brain storm right away. Eventually, I came up with the idea for Green Hollow.\n\n        I decided to satisfy the theme through the setting and story of the game. The premise was that small creatures were living in an old pine tree that was nearing the end of its life. Due to some natural disasters in the past, their pine tree was the last one remaining in the local area and only one pine cone remained at the top of the tree. The player's goal would be to reach the pine cone and use it to grow a new tree that the creatures could live in. \n\n        Since I had mainly focused on the setting and story so far, I decided to start development by working on some artwork for the player character. This was different for me as I usually would try to nail down the game's mechanics first. But seeing the player character come to life right out of the gate really got me excited to bring the whole vision together. For the sake of time, I decided to build the controls very similarly to Let There Be Light. As for the combat, I made a simple three round burst attack  where the player character throws dead pine needles. The enemies had the same attack with a static cool down.\n\n        After movement and combat were finished, the next thing to tackle was level building. I was very excited for this as this would be the first time I had reached this point in a game's development cycle since my first few tutorial game projects. I tried my best to build the levels in a way that felt like the player was climbing up to the top of the tree, while also making the climb interesting with a mix of combat segments and fun platforming segments. Visually, I used clumps of pine needs to obscure the  player's view a bit to give the feeling of being in a dense pine tree. After that, all that was left was to slap together some cut scenes to explain the story to the player.\n\n        And just like that, a week had passed and a brand new game had been completed! I couldn't believe how much fun I had working on this game. The story and setting of a game have always been what draws me in the most. Since most of the game play features had already been fleshed out in Let There Be Light, I got to really focus on those story telling aspects of the game. And it really re-awakened my passion for game development. \n\n        Unfortunately, I had some technical issues when I tried to submit the game, so I was not considered in the scoring of the game jam. But I still got to have people play the game and leave their feedback, which was a great experience. Lastly, I created a dev log of my experience and posted it to YouTube. It turned out very well and I love that I can relive my first game jam through that video.

The original project had a monster health bar, player health  bar, "attack", "special attack", "heal", and "surrender" buttons, a "Game Over" screen with a "start new game" button, and a battle log tracking the player\'s and monster\'s actions. That was all there was to it. After defeating the monster or losing to it, the game would just refresh and you would start over. This was completely fine since the game was meant to be a simple project for the purpose of practicing some basic concepts such as event binding and conditionals. But for some reason, I really enjoyed working on this simple project. So, as I advanced through the rest of the course, If I felt that I needed more practice on a certain subject, I would come back to "Monster Slayer" and either expand on it or rework the already existing components to be more dynamic and functional.\n      \n        \tI first revisited it after learning about components and props. I reworked the whole project by splitting each element on the screen into its own component and passed data between them with props and events. I added the ability to start a new battle after winning or losing, without refreshing the browser. This kept the player\'s health from going back to 100%. Next I added the ability to heal in between each battle. After that, I added an array of monsters with different amounts of health to give the battles a bit of diversity. Still, being able to heal with no consequence between each battle made it pretty easy. So, next on the list was gold. Each win rewarded the player with gold, and the player had to spend that gold in order to heal himself. \n       \n        \tThe next time I revisited this project, I had completed the Udemy course. The main concept I needed to practice was the Vuex store. Using, the store, I reworked the project again. This time I created one central store with a "player" module, and a "monster" module. All of the data for the game went in the store and these modules. With this increased organization, it was not too difficult to add new statistics to the game. I was able to give both the player and each individual monster their own health, attack, and defense stats. The player also had "maximum mana" and "intelligence" stats which affected how the player would use the "heal" and "special attack" buttons. \n\n        \tLastly, just because I wanted to, I gave the player the ability to level up. This was my largest addition as it meant I had to create a way to track the player\'s experience points, a way to award the player with experience points, monster level, and a level up menu to give the player a choice in what stats would increase with each level up. Though it sounded like a lot of work, I knew this addition would make the game a lot more interesting. So, I had plenty of motivation to work on it and was able to implement and get it to a state that I was satisfied with in just under a week. \n\n        \tThere are still things I would like to add to this project, but I\'m not sure if I will ever get around to doing that. The purpose of this project was just to practice and I have definately gotten the practice I needed through this project. I also don\'t see this project being profitable in any way, and even if it was, it was born from Maximillian\'s project, so I\'m not sure I could claim it. So unfortunately, there doesn\'t seem to be much reason to continue this project unless I just want a break from whatever my current project is at the time.\n      '})},Xt=Jt,Zt=Object(m["a"])(Xt,Qt,Ut,!1,null,null,null),Kt=Zt.exports,ea=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,o=e._self._c||t;return o("base-detailed-project-view",{attrs:{title:"Town Builder",source:a("8b0a"),text:e.formattedText}})},ta=[],aa={components:{BaseDetailedProjectView:Mt},data:()=>({formattedText:'\n        \tAt the time of this project\'s creation, I had only ever practiced game development by following along with youtube tutorials. I decided to put my skills to the test and see what I had learned. As I thought about what type of game I wanted to create, I thought about my favorite aspects of games that I had played. I wanted my game to have the ability to explore, fight bosses, level up, and use gathered materials to make visible upgrades to something. From these goals, the one I was most concerned about was "making visible upgrades to something." I wanted the ability to craft and upgrade armor, but when doing research on how to create this functionality, it proved to be more work than I was ready for. So, I thought instead it would be fun to create and upgrade buildings. And that\'s the story of how "2D Town  Builder Dungeon Explorer" was born (or "Town Builder" for short).\n            \n        Besides that initial brain storm, no planning went into this project at all. I would sit down, think of something that could be added to the game, and start working on creating that thing. Due to that lack of planning, this project was very vulnerable to scope creep (changes, continuous or uncontrolled growth in a project’s scope). This was the first time I experienced this in such a noticeable way. I remember being in the middle of creating an asset and thinking to myself "Why am I creating this again?" Before long, this project became very overwhelming and frustrating. After introducing a game breaking bug and being unable to resolve the issue, I decided I needed more experience before attempting something of this scale. \n\n        Despite how it sounds, this project was not a total disaster. I created my first playable character and my first enemies with animations and attacks. The player had a fully functioning inventory system. There were shops where the player could buy potions, weapons and buildings. Buying a weapon or potion would add your purchase to your inventory. Clicking the weapon would equip it and allow you to attack with it, while clicking the potion would allow you to heal and consume the potion. Buying a building would switch the game\'s camera to the build camera, and switch the games controls to build controls. The player could choose a location in a restricted area to place a building which he could later upgrade. All of this stuff worked almost as well as I imagined. Sadly I eventually introduced a bug that broke the build camera. This was the bug that discouraged me from continuing the project. But I was still really impressed with how far I had come, and I had learned a really valuable, lesson about the importance of project planning.  \n\n        I currently have no plans to revive the project, but I am super proud of this one. I think some day, maybe with a small team, I would like to come back and see where I can take this idea. \n        '})},oa=aa,sa=Object(m["a"])(oa,ea,ta,!1,null,null,null),ia=sa.exports,na=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,o=e._self._c||t;return o("base-detailed-project-view",{attrs:{title:"A Simplified Canteen",source:a("b781"),text:e.formattedText}})},ra=[],la={components:{BaseDetailedProjectView:Mt},data:()=>({formattedText:'\n        \tMy first taste of coding was Java 101 at Illinois Central Community College back in Fall of 2016. My professor had an exciting scene from "School House of Rock" playing as he waited for everyone to find their way to class. Once class had finally started, he started asking questions about different coding languages. The student sitting to my right answered the first couple of questions without hesitation and soon started to act as if he were bored with these basic questions. I, on the other hand, had just discovered that code is written in many different languages. Most of what I had just heard was complete gibberish and I was starting to think that I was in the wrong place. My professor then started walking us through the famous "Hello World" example project. Today that project sounds like it shouldn\'t be intimidating in any way, but the different features of the Net Beans IDE, the strange words making up the class declaration and main method and the different colored words were all totally foreign to me and my professor made no mention of them. He didn\'t want to overwhelm us trying to explain what all of that stuff meant, but I got the false impression that I should already know what all of that is. After we had finished the example project I raised my hand and let the professor know that I had never looked code a day in my life, and asked if I was in the right place. Thankfully, he assured me that this course was designed for people at that level and that it was normal to be confused after day one. I was not the only student who let out a big sigh of relief to that answer.\n\n        \tAfter about a month, I was really started to enjoy coding. I often found myself doing more than my assignments required just to see what I would work. As fun as it was, I still saw it as "homework." It would be about a full 2 years of hearing people tell me "To be a good programmer, you need to be coding all of the time," before I finally created something on my own. I decided that I liked programming and I wanted to be good at it. But what would I create? Well what pushed me towards programming in the first place? That would be an interest in game development. So I looked towards my favorite game at the time, "Monster Hunter World."\n\n        \t"Monster Hunter World" had a restaurant called "The Canteen." Before players set out to hunt a massive monster, they would first want to visit "The Canteen" to fill their stomachs. At this restaurant, players could choose a bunch of different meals or create their own. Depending on what was chosen, the player would get different boosts to their stats for the duration of their next hunt. I\'m not sure why, but I loved this idea. "A Simplified Canteen" was my attempt to recreate a simpler version of this system. \n\n        \tSince "A Simplified Canteen" was not a game with players, I created a class called "player" and gave it variables such as name, Health, Attack, ect. I then created several text menus that waited for the user to input a number representing their desired selection. The user would repeat this process for Entre, Side, Veggie, and Drink. Each menu choice would alter a different stat. After confirming their selection, the program would show the user the altered stats. And, that\'s all there was to the project. \n\n        \tThis project was so simple it almost isn\'t worth displaying here, but it was my first creation. The first thing that I could call "mine." I was so proud of it that I ran the program over and over again just to see the different results I would get. I showed it to all of my friends, though most of them weren\'t to sure what they were looking at. This program was the first time I truly felt like a programer and that\'s why it deserves to be on this portfolio.\n      '})},da=la,ca=Object(m["a"])(da,na,ra,!1,null,null,null),ha=ca.exports;i["a"].use(H["a"]);var ma=new H["a"]({routes:[{path:"/",redirect:"/home"},{path:"/home",component:Me},{path:"/dev-log",component:ht},{path:"/resume",component:yt},{path:"/aboutMe",component:Ct},{path:"/let-there-be-light-details",component:Dt},{path:"/green-hollow-details",component:Nt},{path:"/monster-slayer-details",component:Kt},{path:"/town-builder-details",component:ia},{path:"/canteen-view-details",component:ha}]}),ua=a("f309"),pa=a("fcf4");i["a"].use(ua["a"]);var fa=new ua["a"]({theme:{themes:{light:{primary:pa["a"].grey,secondary:pa["a"].lime.darken4,hover:"#2e2c2c",button:"#1a1917"}}}});a("d1e7");const ga=(e,t)=>{e.scrollPosY=t},wa=(e,t)=>{e.scrollHeight=t},ya=e=>e.scrollPosY,va=e=>e.scrollHeight;i["a"].use(x["a"]);const ba=new x["a"].Store({state:{scrollPosY:0,scrollHeight:0},getters:s,mutations:o});var Ia=a("8cb8");i["a"].config.productionTip=!1,i["a"].use(Ia["default"]),new i["a"]({router:ma,vuetify:fa,store:ba,render:e=>e(Y)}).$mount("#app")},"587f":function(e,t,a){},6774:function(e,t,a){},7040:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a("aa7a")},"71d3":function(e,t,a){},7282:function(e,t,a){},"7a7e":function(e,t,a){},"84dd":function(e,t,a){},"89a0":function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/OldPlayer.15cf61cf.png"},"8b0a":function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"media/TownBuilderDungeonExplorer.29ec14c3.mp4"},"962e":function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/cSharpIcon.342f6801.svg"},"989d":function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/unity3d-icon.bf401787.svg"},a28e:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a("7a7e")},aa4f:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/amazon_aws-icon.65750278.svg"},aa7a:function(e,t,a){},b5e4:function(e,t,a){},b781:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"media/ASimplifiedCanteen.f415658b.mp4"},cf05:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/logo.82b9c7a5.png"},e354:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"media/MonsterSlayer.b4d42cc2.mp4"},e36c:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"media/GreenHollowDemo.69c16cff.mp4"},eb1d:function(e,t,a){},eec5:function(e,t,a){},f09d:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/java-icon.249fe040.svg"}});
