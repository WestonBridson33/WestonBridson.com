time. It was why \n        I decided to learn how to write code. After spending the weekend at a retreat held by the Newman \n        Center at Illinois State University, I was fired up and decided it was time to start working toward that \n        goal. I sat down with my Legend of Zelda notebook and started to brainstorm. Since I had spent the \n        weekend trying to grow closer to God, that\'s mainly what was on my mind during this brainstorm. I \n        actually came up with the name, "Let There Be Light" first. The idea that followed was an \n        exploration based platformer with no combat. The setting would have been very dark and the game \n        would have been about using light to dispel the darkness so the player could find their way to \n        heaven. The light the player would have used would have been a symbol for God leading the player in the right direction.\n                    ',postImage:"",postYoutube:"",postLocalVid:"",postWidth:""},{id:"1",postDate:new Date("03/01/2020").toString(),postTitle:"Development Begins",postText:"I had an idea and some motivation! I got right to work and began making my prototype. I grabbed \n    this png online and made him move and crafted an area to walk around in. I created objects that \n    would trigger shortcuts to open. And lastly, a light. As I walked around trying to think of how this\n    game would work, I realized that this was not very exciting and quickly became boring. So, I went \n    back to the drawing board. I started thinking about what I wanted this game to accomplish and I \n    settled on two main points. \n    \n    1.) I wanted to expose the Catholic faith to the world. It is something that is often misunderstood \n        and something that I felt I had to hide for most of my life. I hoped that if more media with Catholic \n        themes and imagery existed, then people would be more accepting of it. This point would inspire a \n        lot of the art and setting of the game. \n        \n    2.) I wanted share some of the lessons I have learned while pursuing my faith. One of the strongest \n        lessons I've learned is the importance of being able to recognize your own weakness and rely on \n        your community to lift you up. Though, I've always been a bit solitary, so it was always much \n        easier for me to look to heaven for assistance. I wanted to reflect this in the main character. \n        \n    My first thought was to have the source of his power be directly from God, but I didn't love this idea. \n    I wanted God's involvement to be more subtle. That's when I thought about the saints. I knew very \n    little about them, but had been hearing about them more and more while being at the Newman \n    Center. Involving them in this way would give me more of a reason to get to know them more, which \n    was something I wanted to do. So, I had a main character in pursuit of heaven. He was powerless \n    on his own, but had the saints, who were very devoted to God, to assist him on his journey.

I decided that I would take a week off and then begin some online courses \n    on game development. \"Why the courses,\" you might ask? Well, for my job, the company I work for \n    bought me a course on Udemy for a framework called VueJS. This course was 80 hours and gave \n    me a great foundation for the framework. Any foundation I have for game development has come \n    from random youtube videos that did not build off of each other very well. Any foundation I \n    currently have in game development is covered with cracks. I want to fill those cracks so I can be more confident in my abilities. \n    \n    Unfortunately, before I got started on those courses, I fell into another deep slump. My routine \n    suffered, my prayer life suffered, my motivation suffered. This is exactly the reason why I decided to \n    ease back into development with a smaller project. During the slump, I became frustrated with \n    myself for entering this state of low energy again. It happens way too often and I needed to figure \n    out why and deal with it. But of course, I was in the middle of a slump, so I didn't have much energy \n    to do that. For the next month and half or so, I spent 90% of my free time just playing games. I \n    enjoyed that time at least, but I wasn't happy with how compulsively I was playing them.\n    \n    In the last few weeks, I started re-connecting with some friends I haven't seen in a long time, and \n    making more of an effort to check-in with those I am close with. This definitely helped me to break \n    out of the slump. After spending some time self reflecting and speaking with a local priest, I \n    decided that I should just try to be more social. These slumps seem to start with me getting sucked \n    into a game and realizing how fun and easy it is to just sit in front of my computer and not worry \n    about anything else. I hoped that by making more of an effort to be around friends and family, I \n    would be less likely to let myself be so isolated. The priest didn't discount this idea, but was wise \n    enough to see that I might struggle with actually making that happen. I have always been more \n    antisocial, and it doesn't take too much social activity to run my batteries dry. He then suggested \n    that I get a dog. I laughed at first because I didn't expect that answer from a priest, but it actually \n    made a lot of sense. He explained that it wouldn't require much social energy, but it would require \n    me to focus on it throughout the day. I wouldn't be able to totally isolate myself with this creature\n    relying on me for food and exercise. And, I can't say this was the first time I had considered getting \n    a dog in recent months. The life of an antisocial full-time web-developer, part-time game-developer, \n    passionate video gamer can easily get pretty lonely. Normally my connection with God has always \n    gotten me through that feeling, but there are less people in my life now than there ever has been \n    before. A dog might be the perfect answer to that problem.\n    \n    I haven't made any decisions yet, and there are other expenses that I need to take care of before I \n    even start looking at what I would need to take care of a dog. But I wanted to update you all on what \n    had been going on in my life and let you know that I still plan on returning to video making in May. I \n    would really like to be able to work consistently on \"Let There Be Light,\" and make regular dev-log \n    videos on Youtube. But, in order for that to happen I have to identify and remove the obstacles that \n    have caused me to stop in the past. So, I apologize for the wait, but I believe it will pay off in the \n    long run.

I was able to give both the player and each \n        individual monster their own health, attack, and defense stats.
