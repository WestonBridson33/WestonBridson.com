As I walked around trying to think of how this\n    game would work, I realized that this was not very exciting and quickly became boring. So, I went \n    back to the drawing board. I started thinking about what I wanted this game to accomplish and I \n    settled on two main points. \n    \n    1.) I wanted to expose the Catholic faith to the world. It is something that is often misunderstood \n        and something that I felt I had to hide for most of my life. I hoped that if more media with Catholic \n        themes and imagery existed, then people would be more accepting of it. This point would inspire a \n        lot of the art and setting of the game. \n        \n    2.) I wanted share some of the lessons I have learned while pursuing my faith. One of the strongest \n        lessons I've learned is the importance of being able to recognize your own weakness and rely on \n        your community to lift you up. Though, I've always been a bit solitary, so it was always much \n        easier for me to look to heaven for assistance. I wanted to reflect this in the main character. \n        \n    My first thought was to have the source of his power be directly from God, but I didn't love this idea. \n    I wanted God's involvement to be more subtle. That's when I thought about the saints. I knew very \n    little about them, but had been hearing about them more and more while being at the Newman \n    Center. Involving them in this way would give me more of a reason to get to know them more, which \n    was something I wanted to do. So, I had a main character in pursuit of heaven. He was powerless \n    on his own, but had the saints, who were very devoted to God, to assist him on his journey.

At a very young age I became infatuated with video games\n      and their ability to bring worlds to life and tell stories in a very unique way. Naturally I hoped to be able to create my own games some day.\n      As I grew, my interest in games only increased and so did my interest in the Catholic faith. I was raised in the faith attending mass and CCD\n      every Sunday. At a young age I developed the practice of praying daily, but didn\'t really start to develop my faith until high school. It wasn\'t\n      until trying to select my major for college that I would decide that I wanted to create Catholic themed video games. Soon after making this\n      decision, I began watching youtube tutorials on the subject. The next two years would be dedicated to practicing and learning all I could \n      about game development. The specific idea for "Let There Be Light" wouldn\'t come until my junior year.\n\n      \t\tTo start my 3rd year of college, I transferred to Illinois State University. One of the first things I did there was introduce myself to the \n      St. John Paul II Catholic Newman Center on campus. A place that I would spend the majority of my time for the next 2 years, learning all that\n      I could about the Catholic Faith and how to live it. In February of my junior year, after going on a retreat led by the Newman Center, I was fired\n      up to finally start creating my first Catholic game.\n\n      \t\tThe original Idea for "Let There Be Light" was to have the main action of the game be lighting torches to dispel the darkness around you. By \n      doing so, the light would be both protecting you from the dark, and leading you down the correct path. I had no plans of the player performing \n      any sort of attacks. I hoped this would give the player a sense of reliance on the light, which was meant to be an allegory for the power of God. \n      However, after creating a quick prototype, it was clear that making this idea fun would be challenging. I reminded myself that this would be my \n      first game and that I should keep it simple. So, after some more brain storming, I decided on a simple, action based platformer that would have \n      a "Dark Souls" style progression system. When thinking of player combat, I wanted to somehow keep that sense of reliance. \n      \n      \t\tFrom the Newman Center, I had been learning a bit about the saints and how powerful prayer with them can be. Saints are people who were \n      very devoted to their faith and had a very close relationship with God. When we pray to saints, we are asking our brothers and sisters in Christ \n      to pray with us and for us. I thought this would be an interesting aspect of my faith to include in "Let There Be Light." Instead of weapons, the \n      player would find "saint pages." Each page would describe a particular saint and allow the player to ask for their intercession. Doing so would \n      grant the player an ability based on the saint. \n\n      \t\tOnce I had a solid plan for all of the different aspects of the game, it was time to start redesigning the prototype. Starting with just a \n      moveable player, a basic enemy, and a "Mega-Man" style attack, it was already much more entertaining. I kept developing the game for about a\n      year. My schedule was not very consistent, but I made decent progress. After showing the game to some friends and receiving very positive \n      feedback, I decided to track the progress of the game on Youtube. I made a Youtube channel, as well as a twitter account and a facebook page.\n      I never use twitter and facebook, so those platforms are a bit awkward for me.

The original project had a monster health bar, player health  bar,\n        "attack", "special attack", "heal", and "surrender" buttons, a "Game Over" screen with a "start new game" button, and a battle log tracking\n        the player\'s and monster\'s actions. That was all there was to it. After defeating the monster or losing to it, the game would just refresh \n        and you would start over. This was completely fine since the game was meant to be a simple project for the purpose of practicing some basic \n        concepts such as event binding and conditionals. But for some reason, I really enjoyed working on this simple project. So, as I advanced \n        through the rest of the course, If I felt that I needed more practice on a certain subject, I would come back to "Monster Slayer" and either\n        expand on it or rework the already existing components to be more dynamic and functional.\n      \n        \tI first revisited it after learning about components and props. I reworked the whole project by splitting each element on the screen into\n        its own component and passed data between them with props and events. I added the ability to start a new battle after winning or losing, \n        without refreshing the browser. This kept the player\'s health from going back to 100%. Next I added the ability to heal in between each \n        battle. After that, I added an array of monsters with different amounts of health to give the battles a bit of diversity. Still, being able\n        to heal with no consequence between each battle made it pretty easy. So, next on the list was gold. Each win rewarded the player with gold, \n        and the player had to spend that gold in order to heal himself. \n       \n        \tThe next time I revisited this project, I had completed the Udemy course. The main concept I needed to practice was the Vuex store. Using,\n        the store, I reworked the project again. This time I created one central store with a "player" module, and a "monster" module. All of the\n        data for the game went in the store and these modules. With this increased organization, it was not too difficult to add new statistics to\n        the game. I was able to give both the player and each individual monster their own health, attack, and defense stats. The player also had \n        "maximum mana" and "intelligence" stats which affected how the player would use the "heal" and "special attack" buttons. \n\n        \tLastly, just because I wanted to, I gave the player the ability to level up. This was my largest addition as it meant I had to create a\n        way to track the player\'s experience points, a way to award the player with experience points, monster level, and a level up menu to give \n        the player a choice in what stats would increase with each level up. Though it sounded like a lot of work, I knew this addition would make\n        the game a lot more interesting. So, I had plenty of motivation to work on it and was able to implement and get it to a state that I was\n        satisfied with in just under a week. \n\n        There are still things I would like to add to this project, but I\'m not sure if I will ever get around to doing that. The purpose of this\n        project was just to practice and I have definately gotten the practice I needed through this project. I also don\'t see this project being \n        profitable in any way, and even if it was, it was born from Maximillian\'s project, so I\'m not sure I could claim it. So unfortunately, \n        there doesn\'t seem to be much reason to continue this project unless I just want a break from whatever my current project is at the time.\n      '})},jt=At,_t=Object(c["a"])(jt,ut,mt,!1,null,null,null),Tt=_t.exports,St=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,o=e._self._c||t;return o("base-detailed-project-view",{attrs:{title:"Town Builder",source:a("8b0a"),text:e.text}})},Dt=[],Lt={components:{BaseDetailedProjectView:xt},data:()=>({text:'\n        \tAt the time of this project\'s creation, I had only ever practiced game development by following along with youtube tutorials. I decided\n        to put my skills to the test and see what I had learned. As I thought about what type of game I wanted to create, I thought about my \n        favorite aspects of games that I had played. I wanted my game to have the ability to explore, fight bosses, level up, and use gathered \n        materials to make visible upgrades to something. From these goals, the one I was most concerned about was "making visible upgrades to \n        something." I wanted the ability to craft and upgrade armor, but when doing research on how to create this functionality, it proved to be \n        more work than I was ready for. So, I thought instead it would be fun to create and upgrade buildings. And that\'s the story of how "2D Town \n        Builder Dungeon Explorer" was born (or "Town Builder" for short).\n            \n        Besides that initial brain storm, no planning went into this project at all. I would sit down, think of something that could be added to \n        the game, and start working on creating that thing. Due to that lack of planning, this project was very vurnerable to scope creep (changes, \n        continuous or uncontrolled growth in a projectâ€™s scope). This was the first time I experienced this in such a noticable way. I remember \n        being in the middle of creating an asset and thinking to myself "Why am I creating this again?" Before long, this project became very \n        overwhelming and frustrating. After introducing a game breaking bug and being unable to resolve the issue, I decided I needed more experience\n        before attempting something of this scale. \n\n        Despite how it sounds, this project was not a total disaster. I created my first playable character and my first enemies with animations and\n        attacks. The player had a fully functioning inventory system. There were shops where the player could buy potions, weapons and buildings. \n        Buying a weapon or potion would add your purchase to your inventory. Clicking the weapon would equip it and allow you to attack with it, while\n        clicking the potion would allow you to heal and consume the potion. Buying a building would switch the game\'s camera to the build camera, and\n        switch the games controls to build controls. The player could choose a location in a restricted area to place a building which he could later\n        upgrade. All of this stuff worked almost as well as I imagined. Sadly I eventually introduced a bug that broke the build camera. This was the\n        bug that disouraged me from continuing the project. But I was still really impressed with how far I had come, and I had learned a really valuable,\n        lesson about the importance of project planning. \n\n        I currently have no plans to revive the project, but I am super proud of this one. I think some day, maybe with a small team, I would like to \n        come back and see where I can take this idea. \n        '})},Bt=Lt,Vt=Object(c["a"])(Bt,St,Dt,!1,null,null,null),Et=Vt.exports,Pt=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,o=e._self._c||t;return o("base-detailed-project-view",{attrs:{title:"A Simplified Canteen",source:a("b781"),text:e.text}})},Ot=[],Mt={components:{BaseDetailedProjectView:xt},data:()=>({text:'\n        \tMy first taste of coding was Java 101 at Illinois Central Community College back in Fall of 2016. My professor had an exciting scene from\n        "School House of Rock" playing as he waited for everyone to find their way to class. Once class had finally started, he started asking\n        questions about different coding languages. The student sitting to my right answered the first couple of questions without hesitation and\n        soon started to act as if he were bored with these basic questions. I, on the other hand, had just discovered that code is written in many\n        different languages. Most of what I had just heard was complete gibberish and I was starting to think that I was in the wrong place. My\n        professor then started walking us through the famous "Hello World" example project. Today that project sounds like it shouldn\'t be\n        intimidating in any way, but the different features of the Net Beans IDE, the strange words making up the class declaration and main method\n        and the different colored words were all totally foreign to me and my professor made no mention of them. He didn\'t want to overwhelm us\n        trying to explain what all of that stuff meant, but I got the false impression that I should already know what all of that is. After we had\n        finished the example project I raised my hand and let the professor know that I had never looked code a day in my life, and asked if I was\n        in the right place. Thankfully, he assured me that this course was designed for people at that level and that it was normal to be confused\n        after day one. I was not the only student who let out a big sigh of releif to that answer.\n\n        \tAfter about a month, I was really started to enjoy coding. I often found myself doing more than my assignments required, just because I\n        was I would get an idea and wanted to see if I could make it work. As fun as it was, I still saw it as "homework." It would be about a full\n        2 years of hearing people tell me "To be a good programmer, you need to be coding all of the time," before I finally created something on my\n        own. I decided that I liked programming and I wanted to be good at it. But what would I create? Well what pushed me towards programming\n        in the first place? That would be an interest in game development. So I looked towards my favorite game at the time, "Monster Hunter World."\n\n        \t"Monster Hunter World" had a restaurant called "The Canteen." Before players set out to hunt a massive monster, they would first want to visit\n        "The Canteen" to fill their stomachs. At this restaurant, players could choose a bunch of different meals or create their own. Depending on \n        what was chosen, the player would get different boosts to their stats for the duration of their next hunt. I\'m not sure why, but I loved this\n        idea. "A Simplified Canteen" was my attempt to recreate a simpler version of this system. \n\n        \tSince "A Simplified Canteen" was not a game with players, I created a class called "player" and gave it variables such as name, Health, Attack,\n        ect. I then created several non-interactable menus that waited for the user to input a number representing their desired selection. The user\n        would repeat this process for Entre, Side, Veggie, and Drink. Each menu choice would alter a different stat. After confirming their selection, \n        the program would show the user the altered stats. And, that\'s all there was to the project. \n\n        \tThis project was so simple it almost isn\'t worth displaying here, but it was my first creation. The first thing that I could call "mine." I\n        was so proud of it that I ran the program over and over again just to see the different results I would get. I showed it to all of my friends,\n        though most of them weren\'t to sure what they were looking at. This program was the first time I truly felt like a programer and that\'s why it \n        deserves to be on this portfolio.\n      '})},Wt=Mt,Rt=Object(c["a"])(Wt,Pt,Ot,!1,null,null,null),Ut=Rt.exports;o["a"].use(O["a"]);var Ft=new O["a"]({routes:[{path:"/",redirect:"/home"},{path:"/home",component:N},{path:"/portfolio",component:Te},{path:"/resume",component:Me},{path:"/dev-log",component:it},{path:"/let-there-be-light-details",component:ht},{path:"/monster-slayer-details",component:Tt},{path:"/town-builder-details",component:Et},{path:"/canteen-view-details",component:Ut}]}),Jt=a("f309"),Ht=a("fcf4");o["a"].use(Jt["a"]);var Gt=new Jt["a"]({theme:{themes:{light:{primary:Ht["a"].grey,secondary:Ht["a"].lime.darken4,hover:"#2e2c2c",button:"#1a1917"}}}});a("d1e7");o["a"].config.productionTip=!1,new o["a"]({el:"#app",router:Ft,vuetify:Gt,render:e=>e(P)})},"59bc":function(e,t,a){"use strict";a("f245")},"5f39":function(e,t,a){"use strict";a("712e")},"6dcb":function(e,t,a){},"712e":function(e,t,a){},"77b3":function(e,t,a){},"7dd9":function(e,t,a){"use strict";a("6dcb")},"84a4":function(e,t,a){"use strict";a("9000")},"89a0":function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/OldPlayer.15cf61cf.png"},"8b0a":function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"media/TownBuilderDungeonExplorer.29ec14c3.mp4"},9e3:function(e,t,a){},9771:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a("cdba")},a127:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a("c144")},a982:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a("adb6")},adb6:function(e,t,a){},b506:function(e,t,a){},b781:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"media/ASimplifiedCanteen.f415658b.mp4"},c144:function(e,t,a){},cdba:function(e,t,a){},ce56:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a("b506")},e354:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"media/MonsterSlayer.b4d42cc2.mp4"},eec5:function(e,t,a){},f245:function(e,t,a){}});
