        <pre>
           I am a student at Illinois State University studying IS - Web/App Development. I
           Chose this field of study because I wanted to combine two of my biggest passions.
           The catholic faith and video gaming. Gaming has a very unique way of telling a story and
           making the player feel like they are a part of that story. My faith is very misunderstood
           in today's world, and I beleive that through video games, I can give people a small taste
           of what it actually means to be a catholic. The world feels dark right now, and it needs
           all of the light it can get. I am hoping that my current game project, "Let There Be 
           Light," can bring a little light to the world. 

           If I am not working on my game or my school work, then I can usully be found at my church.
           whether its volunteering, mass, silent prayer, bible study, or just hanging out with friends, 
           I spend a lot of time there. Life is loud and chaotic, but my church is a safe place where I 
           can relax and make myself at home.

          <h3 style = "text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">Let There Be Light</h3>
          I have been working on "Let There Be Light" for a little less than a year. 
          The game is based off of my own battles against temptation and sin.  
          Unable to overcome the challenges ahead, the player must call upon 
          the power of the saints to help him on his quest. This is acheived by  
          collecting "Saint Pages," which provide a breif summary of a saint, and a 
          prayer to that saint (or at least they will before the game is released). 
          After saying the prayer (or in this case, clicking the "pray button"),  
          the player will gain access to a new attack based on the Saint he prays to. 
          The player can also find "Saint Cards." They are similar to "Saint Pages," 
          but instead of gaining a mighty new attack, the player will receive an  
          increase to his stats. The amounts and specific stats increased will vary
          based on the cards used. Two cards may be active at one time. 
           
          The game is a long way from being finished. I'm sure you can spot  
          a few bugs in the short video provided. Still, I am very proud of what I  
          have accomplished so far. Even if no one ever plays this game, I will not  
          regret the time I've spent on it. It has taught me many valuable skills  
          like project planning, debugging, and flexibility. These are skills that 
          I can take with me to future jobs, and to future projects.

          <h3>Town Builder Dungeon Explorer</h3>
          Based on the title, you can probably already tell that not much planninng 
          went into this game. The idea for this game was to build a town that 
          would serve as a home base. A place where the player could purchase 
          upgrades and other items. The materials for new buildings and upgrades
          would be found by exploring the area surrounding the town and locating boss 
          lairs. Inside the lair would be a tough enemy that would drop materials, 
          gold, and weapons upon being defeated. This was the first game that 
          I worked on that wasn't part of a tutorial, and I am proud of 
          how far it came. But, i was simply not experienced enough to make a game of 
          this style. I planned almost nothing ahead of time. I would work super hard
          on creating assets before I even asked basic questions like, "what purpose 
          will this serve?" My code was so unorganized that any bug could potentially 
          take an hour or more to fix. 

          As messy and frustrating as this game became, it was still my first one, 
          and I am proud of it. It showed me that I have the power to bring my ideas 
          to life. I learned that if there's something that I don't know how to do, 
          there is no reason why I can not learn it. And I definately learned the 
          importance of project planning and organization. A project becomes 
          overwhelming very quickly if you don't have a good sense of direction.

          <h3>A Simplified Canteen</h3>
          My first project! Isn't it beautiful?

          This project was never meant to become anything. It was just the first time I
          said "Lets see what I can do." Up to this point in my programming career, I
          had only every worked on programs that were assigned to me for my java classes. 
          It was very cool, and reassurring to see that I could make something like this 
          without the help of my professor. 

          The idea comes from a game called "Monster Hunter World." The game has a 
          restaurant called "The Canteen" where the player can order different 
          ingredients for their meal. The player will receive different stat boosts based
          on the ingredients they ordered. I attempted to make my own version of this system.
          "A Simplified Canteen" asks for the user's name. Then it displays some stats that
          are the same every time. It then lists some entre`s with a price, and a stat 
          modification. The user inputs a number corresponding to their desired entre. The 
          user repeats that for sides, drinks, and a vegetable choice. The program then displays
          the total price and asks the user to confirm their choices. Typeing "no" will take
          the player back to entre's. Typeing "yes" will display the user's name and updated
          stats.
