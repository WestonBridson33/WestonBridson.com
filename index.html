        <pre>
           I am a student at Illinois State University studying IS - Web/App Development. I
           Chose this field of study because I wanted to combine two of my biggest passions.
           The catholic faith and video gaming. Gaming has a very unique way of telling a story and
           making the player feel like they are a part of that story. My faith is very misunderstood
           in today's world, and I beleive that through video games, I can give people a small taste
           of what it actually means to be a catholic. The world feels dark right now, and it needs
           all of the light it can get. I am hoping that my current game project, "Let There Be 
           Light," can bring a little light to the world. 

           If I am not working on my game or my school work, then I can usully be found at my church.
           whether its volunteering, mass, silent prayer, bible study, or just hanging out with friends, 
           I spend a lot of time there. Life is loud and chaotic, but my church is a safe place where I 
           can relax and make myself at home.
