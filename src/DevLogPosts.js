        postText: `   I had wanted to make a game with strong Catholic and Christian themes for a long time. It was why I decided to learn how to write code. 
                    After spending the weekend at a retreat held by the Newman Center at Illinois State University, I was fired up and decided it was time
                    to start working toward that goal. I sat down with my Legend of Zelda notebook and started to brainstorm. Since I had spent the weekend 
                    trying to grow closer to God, that's mainly what was on my mind during this brainstorm. I actually came up with the name, "Let There Be Light"
                    first. The idea that followed was an exploration based platformer with no combat. The setting would have been very dark and the game would have 
                    been about using light to dispel the darkness so the player could find their way to heaven. The light the player would have used would have been 
                    a symbol for God leading the player in the right direction.

        postText: `I had an idea and some motivation! I got right to work and began making my prototype. I grabbed this png online and made him move and crafted 
                    an area to walk around in. I created objects that would trigger shortcuts to open. And lastly, a light. As I walked around trying to think of how this
                    game would work, I realized that this was not very exciting and quickly became boring. So, I went back to the drawing board. I started thinking about
                    what I wanted this game to accomplish and I settled on two main points. 1.) I wanted to expose the Catholic faith to the world. It is something that 
                    is often misunderstood and something that I felt I had to hide for most of my life. I hoped that if more media with Catholic themes and imagery existed,
                    then people would be more accepting of it. This point would inspire a lot of the art and setting of the game. 2.) I wanted share some of the lessons I 
                    have learned while pursuing my faith. One of the strongest lessons I've learned is the importance of being able to recognize your own weakness and rely
                    on your community to lift you up. Though, I've always been a bit of a loner, so it was always much easier for me to look to heaven for assistance. I wanted
                    to reflect this in the main character. My first thought was to have the source of his power be directly from God, but I didn't love this idea. If God were to
                    end up being in this game I would want his involvement to be more subtle. That's when I thought about the saints. I knew very little about them, but had been
                    hearing about them more and more while being at the Newman Center. Involving them in this way would give me more of a reason to get to know them more, which
                    was something I wanted to do. So, I had a main character in pursuit of heaven. He was powerless on his own, but had the saints, who were very devoted to God, 
                    to assist him on his journey. I was really liking this idea and it was what I ended up sticking with.`,

                    proved a much bigger challenge than I was expecting. I youtuber by the name of "DevDuck" had mentioned that showing his game off to people and receiving feedback
                    was a big motivator for him. So, I thought I would give it a try. I wanted to try and create dev-log youtube videos. I hoped that having that responsibility would
                    help me to develop a schedule and stick to it. I also knew that social media was a great way for developers to start up a fanbase. So, I sat down at my computer 
                    and started my youtube channel. I chose the name "Gospels and Games" because I knew my channel would be touching on both gaming and religous topics. Soon after, I 
                    began working on my very first dev-log video.`,

                    my responsibilities at the Newman Center, it was too much and I had to put development on hold. Once summer started and I was getting comfortable at my internship, I
                    felt I had the time to try development and youtube again. The game was in a pretty buggy state. If I was going to start showing the game weekly, I thought it would be
                    a good idea to clean some of these up. Development in general would also just be more enjoyable after the bugs were taken care of.`,

                    when I got home at the end of the day. However, until this point, I had still been attending almost every weekly event at the Newman Center on campus. Following the same schedule
                    that I followed when I was still a student. This, by no means, is a bad way to spend time. As I have said before, it is very important to have a supporting community. However, I needed
                    to dedicate a lot more time to development if I wanted to accomplish anything. So, I began distancing myself from the place and community that played a very vital role in forming
                    who I am today. It was tough, but it was a good decision. I normally spent about 14 hours there every week. I still had good supporting friends who I see regularly, but I also now
                    had time to work both on projects and myself. For the first time in years, I was not relying on the structure of the Newman Center to decide how I used my time. It was up to me and
                    it was harder than I expected. At first, when I got home from work, I defaulted to my favorite pass times. I played video games and watched youtube videos pretty much all night until
                    I had to go to sleep. This went on for a time, until I finally took a look at myself and realized that I was living the way that I did in high school. I had pretty much set all of the
                    disciplines that the Newman Center taught me to the side, which was not what I left the Center to do. So, I sat down to plan out a weekly routine for myself that would include exercise,
                    rest, development time, and prayer. I had attempted to do this many times in the past, but I failed to find a routine that I could keep up, while also sticking to the Newman Center's 
                    schedule. Now, I did not have that problem. I finally came up with a healthy routine that I could sustain. It wasn't perfect, but it got me started on this website. I didn't want to 
                    jump straight back into "Let There Be Light." That project is large and can easily be overwhelming. I thought it would be best to develop this routine with a smaller project before I 
                    jump back in. Besides, WestonBridson.com is something I had been wanting to do for a long time. `,
